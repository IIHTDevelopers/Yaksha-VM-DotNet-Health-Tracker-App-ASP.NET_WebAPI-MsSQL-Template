1. All actions such as building, compiling, running the application, and executing test cases will be performed using the Visual Studio interface. Rather than using the command terminal, the necessary operations will be initiated through the buttons, menus, and features available within the Visual Studio IDE.
 
2. Press Ctrl + S to save your code.

3. Steps to Apply Migration(Code first approach):

	- Go to "Tools" -> "NuGet Package Manager" -> "Package Manager Console" from the top menu bar of Visual Studio.

	- After clicking on "Package Manager Console," a new tab should open at the bottom of the Visual Studio window, displaying the Package Manager Console.

8. To run test cases in your project in Visual Studio, click on "Test" -> “Run All Tests” in the top menu.  (You can run this command multiple times to identify the test case status, and refactor code to make maximum test cases passed before final submission).

9. Steps to push changes to GitHub:
	- Go to "View" -> "Git Changes" from the top menu bar of Visual Studio.

	- In the "Changes" window on the right side of Visual Studio, you'll see the modified files.

10. You need to follow step-9 compulsorily, before final submission as well. This will push or save the updated contents in the internal git/repository, and will be used to evaluate the code quality.
